## Data and packages

We start with loading the packages we'll use.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
#| label: import-data

gfm_data <- read.csv("~/5306/data/gfm_cleaned_data.csv")
```

## Data Analysis

-   Time analysis:

    -   Are there seasonal variations in campaign success on GoFundMe? Do certain times of the year witness more successful campaigns?

    -   How does the length of the fundraising campaign impact its success? Are longer or shorter campaigns more effective in reaching their funding goals?

```{r}
#| label: time-analysis
